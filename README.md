Currently, there are two models that can be used to predict thermal conductivity in this project, a model for predicting fluids in general -, and a model for ionic liquids -, and they will use the Transformer model to first write the SMILES code They will use the Transformer model to write the SMILES code first, and then use a mixture of other eigenvalues to predict the thermal conductivity. The eigenvalues you need to enter are: 'Total CP:', 'SMILES', 'Total S:', 'Zero point energy (ZPE):', 'Thermal correction to G:', 'Thermal correction to U:', 'GAP ENERGY', 'Molar Mass', 'Density', 'H-ENERGY', 'HOMO', 'Electronic energy:'. Please contact smli@ipe.ac.cn if you have any questions during utilization.
